# Open Knight Online (OpenKO)

We started this project to learn more about how the MMORPG Knight Online works. MMORPGs are very intricate programs requiring knowledge in many areas of computer science such as TCP/IP, SQL server, performance tuning, 3D graphics and animation, load balancing, and more. Starting with the original leaked source we have updated to DirectX 9, added function flags so that various file formats may be supported while remaining backwards compatible, and much much more.

This code is for academic purposes only! If you have questions, or would like help getting started, feel free visit the <a href="http://ko4life.net/topic/50-the-openko-project/" target="_blank">forums</a>.

## Prerequisites

### Visual Studio 2022

You will also need the following components installed, which can be installed from within Visual Studio via:
 * `Tools`
 * `Get Tools and Features...`
 * `Individual Components`.
 
Use the search field to find them from there.

#### Components to install:
 * C++ ATL for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)
 * C++ MFC for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)
 * MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest) 

### Microsoft SQL Server Express/Developer

Along with its accompanying SQL Server Management Studio.

Additionally, you will need to download and restore the database over on our <a href="http://ko4life.net/topic/50-the-openko-project/" target="_blank">ko4life thread</a>, which restores fine as of Microsoft SQL Server 2022.

### Git or Github Desktop

This is a personal preference.

You can find Git for Windows here:
https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

Or Github Desktop here:
https://desktop.github.com/download/

## Getting started

### Clone our repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Open-KO/KnightOnline.git
```

If using Github Desktop, you can instead clone via `File` -> `Clone repository...` -> `URL` and then paste in our URL:
```
https://github.com/Open-KO/KnightOnline.git
```

### Update and build our third party dependencies
 
You can double-click `update_dependencies.cmd` in the root directory to automatically initialise and update all of our submodules and build the relevant third party dependencies.

Alternatively, you can update them manually via:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If you update them manually, you should also load up `ThirdParty.sln` to build them (ideally you should build both `Debug` and `Release` configurations; this should only really be done once, and whenever we update them).

Note that `update_dependencies.cmd` can simply be run at any time to update and rebuild them.

### Run the solution

Solutions are available in the root directory:

Currently we have:
* `Client.sln` - for just the client project and its dependencies.
* `Server.sln` - for just the server projects and their dependencies.
* `All.sln` - intended to house all of the various solutions, although at the current time we do not include most of the tools (these are instead found in their respective folders).

## Goals

At this early stage in development, the goal of this project is to replicate official client functionality while preserving accuracy and compatibility with the official client and server.
This allows us to be able to side-by-side the client/server for testing purposes.

We do not intend to introduce features not found in the official client, nor introduce custom behaviour in general. You're very welcome to do so in forks however, but these do not mesh with our design goals and introduce complexity and potentially incompatibility with the official client. Essentially, in the interests of accuracy, we'd like to keep the client's behaviour as close to official as possible, where it makes sense.

We may deviate in some minor aspects where it makes sense to fix, for example, UI behaviour, or to provide the user with error messages where the client may not officially do so, but these changes do not affect compatibility while improving the user experience.

Pull requests for such changes will be accepted on a case-by-case basis.

As a hard-and-fast rule, this means we **DO NOT** change client assets or the network protocol between the client and game server (Ebenezer).

The client **MUST** remain compatible with the official client and the official server.

We do not intend to keep the backend servers compatible with the official ones (e.g. our AI server standing in for the 1.298 AI server and vice versa).
This is largely more work than really necessary to maintain. Side-by-side testing with the server files as a collective is more than sufficient here.

Late in development when side-by-side development is rarely necessary, it will make sense to start deviating from official behaviour for improvements and custom features.
At such time, we will welcome such changes, but doing so this early just creates incompatibilities (making it harder to test them side-by-side) and unnecessarily diverts
attention when there's so much official behaviour/features still to implement, update and fix.

## Intentional design decisions

* _The project is currently focused around supporting the 1298/9 version of the game_. Version 1298/9 has most of the core functionality attributed to the game’s success. By ignoring later versions of the game we keep the system relatively simplistic. This allows us to strengthen the fundamental components of the game while minimizing the amount of reverse engineering necessary to make things work.

* _We stick to the 1298/9 database schema_. To ensure compatibility with the 1298/9 version of the game we do not modify the basic database schema. This means the structure of the database and how information is stored in the database doesn’t change while we are working. This could change once the core functionality of the 1298/9 is in place.
